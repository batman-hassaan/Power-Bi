# Pokémon Statistical Analysis & Battle Performance Predictor

## Overview
This project analyzes Pokémon battle statistics to uncover dominant traits and optimal team compositions. The analysis focuses on:
- Type advantages and stat distributions
- Legendary vs non-legendary comparisons
- Mega Evolution impacts
- Generation-based trends

## Dataset
The dataset contains 800+ Pokémon with:
- Basic attributes (Name, Pokédex #, Generation)
- Type information (Primary/Secondary types)
- Combat stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Sp. Atk, Sp. Def, Speed)
- Classification (Legendary status, Mega variants)

## Key Features
### Type Analysis
- Heatmap visualization of average stats by type
- Frequency distribution of Pokémon types

### Legendary Benchmarking
- Statistical comparison of legendary vs regular Pokémon
- Pie chart showing distribution

### Mega Evolution
- Radar charts comparing base vs Mega forms
- Stat improvement analysis

### Generation Trends
- Violin plots showing stat distributions
- Evolution of combat effectiveness across generations

## Visualizations
1. **Heatmap** - Average stats by Pokémon type
2. **Bar Plot** - Top 10 Pokémon by total stats
3. **Pie Chart** - Legendary vs non-legendary ratio
4. **Scatter Plot** - Special Attack vs Special Defense
5. **Radar Chart** - Mega Evolution comparisons
6. **Violin Plot** - Attack distribution by generation

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- Libraries:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - Sweetviz (for automated EDA)
